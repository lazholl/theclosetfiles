          ENNEAD, a group of nine, started as a collection of nine basic pieces
          for the wardrobe that offer different styles of t-shirts that are more
          feminine and classic than the athletic or too-trendy styles found on
          the market. With clients all over the US, they had to source the most
          functional and travel friendly pieces while not sacrificing the style.
          Their quest as stylists to find the easiest pieces for their client’s
          closets led them to create ENNEAD, a collection of t-shirts and lounge
          wear that can be worn throughout all aspects of one’s day. The
          collection is soft and easy-to-care for fabrics in custom dyed colors
          that are muted and classic. All nine core styles can easily work for
          the same client, dressed up or down, for any age or climate. Jordan
          and Meg continue to create new styles every season based on the needs
          of their clients and the lack in the market, as Ennead was created to
          be worn as ones uniform.
