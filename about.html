          After more than 15 years in retail honing their craft, best friends
          Meg Chapman and Jordan LaValle decided to also become business
          partners and start The Closet Files, a private, referral based, full
          service operation that specializes in all aspects of styling and
          organizing one’s wardrobe.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          From shopping and packing to categorizing and re-selling, Meg and
          Jordan work as partners bringing two different perspectives and points
          of view to styling and options of how to dress – in order to
          ultimately cleanse the closet, invest wisely, and achieve a desired
          look.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          Their goal is to create an easy daily interaction with one’s wardrobe,
          where all options are visible and to help one feel great about getting
          dressed each day, whether it be business or pleasure. You will be
          steered in the right direction in terms of investing in the right
          pieces for you and re-coup some money spent on pieces that remain
          unworn or not age appropriate.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          Meg and Jordan’s current roster consists of both private and celebrity
          clients in Los Angeles, Palo Alto, Hawaii, New York, Chicago and the
          Cayman Islands.

              Jordan LaValle’s style is an ode to her Californian bohemian
              roots, classic, but in an unexpected way – feminine, vibrant, and
              spirited. Besides being an entrepreneur, she is a wife, mother of
              4 and avid cook and baker. After graduating High School at the age
              of 16, Jordan LaValle simultaneously pursued a career in music
              while taking culinary courses at California State University,
              Northridge. After years of singing, songwriting and touring,
              Jordan got her feet wet in the fashion industry at Lisa Kline on
              LA’s renowned Robertson Blvd. Throughout the years, Jordan’s
              experiences’ have grown to include serving as a buyer and manager
              of Tracey Ross on Sunset Blvd., head of styling and VIP client and
              studio services for Vince, and a manager and stylist for Lanvin in
              Malibu. Jordan currently resides in Southern California.

                Meg Chapman’s style is an ode to the easy and minimal. Her style
                can be described as somewhere between a tomboy and the French
                girl aesthetic. Besides being an empowered entrepreneur, she is
                a wife, mother of 2 girls, and certified Pilates instructor.
                Graduating from Philadelphia University with a Bachelor’s degree
                in Apparel Management and Marketing and an MBA, Meg Chapman
                started her career working at Nicole Miller In Philadelphia and
                Richmond, VA for 6 years. After that, she advised students for
                one year at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in
                San Diego. Ultimately missing the interaction with clients, Meg
                returned to the retail world working with the luxury powerhouses
                Prada and Lanvin for a total of 10 years, eventually overseeing
                the entire West Coast Retail operation including buying and VIP
                client services for Lanvin. Meg currently resides in Southern
                California.
